### What is iStart - KTH Entrepreneurship Society?

Stockholm produces the second highest number of unicorn companies (startups valued at over one billion dollars) per capita in the world, after Silicon Valley, according to the OECD. This makes Stockholm one of the world’s leading places for anyone interested in entrepreneurship and innovation!

As a member of iStart, you gain direct insight into Stockholm’s entrepreneurial scene. Together, we organize events where we meet startups, investors, mentors, and other relevant players in the startup ecosystem. We also connect with students from similar societies at other universities, both in Sweden and internationally. Pitch competitions, workshops, VC events, and visits to startup
