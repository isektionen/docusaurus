# Sports Council
### Organization
Idrottsnämnden (The Sports Committee) consists of approximately 30 sports enthusiasts within the I-chapter. The committee is led by a board that includes an elected president, vice president, treasurer, activity coordinator, communications coordinator, and internal coordinator, along with various project groups made up of committee members. Throughout the year, these project groups work on organizing different types of events for the entire I-chapter.
### Operations
The mission of Idrottsnämnden is to offer members of the I-chapter wide range of sports-related activities. Balancing studies with exercise and a social life can be challenging, and the Sports Committee aims to make this easier by providing opportunities for social engagement in a sporting spirit.

Some examples of popular activities organized by the Sports Committee throughout the year include football matches against the Stockholm School of Economics and Indek in Uppsala, the ski trip to the Alps, and the running group I-run.
