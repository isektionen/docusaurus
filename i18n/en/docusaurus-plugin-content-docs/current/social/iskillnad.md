# iSkillnad

Skillnad is a comittee that aims to actively contribute to the UN's sustainability goals, Agenda 2030. Among other things, we act as a platform to facilitate the sustainability work of other boards and for the section as a whole. In addition, we also arrange our own events linked to Agenda 2030.

Among other things, we organize breakfasts with companies that work with sustainability in various ways. In addition, every year we hold a Musikhjälpen pub where we in the section together collect money that is donated to Musikhjälpen. Our biggest event is the Run for Change charity race, where we run a race together with companies and donate money to charity at the same time.

We collaborate both with other committees in the section and with charitable organizations to jointly contribute to a sustainable society.
