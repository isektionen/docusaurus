# Members of the Student Council

The Student Council is the chapter's opportunity to influence THS (Tekniska Högskolans Studentkår) activities.

The Council meets about 6 times a year and decides on, among other things, the budget, operational plan and annual report. The Council also elects the union's board and auditors. If you have questions about the Council or THS activities, please contact one of the chapter members of the Council.
