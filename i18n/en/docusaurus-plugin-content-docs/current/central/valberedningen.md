# Election Committee

The election committee at the section consists of three to seven elected members, one of whom is the elected Chairman and one place is reserved for One. The election committee's task is to promote and manage the election process for all elected positions on the section before and during each section meeting. In practical terms, the selection process is as follows:

1. The selection committee opens the application period.
2. Interested candidates apply and may then attend an interview with the Selection Committee.
3. When the selection committee has interviewed all the candidates for a certain position, they draw up a preliminary statement, or recommendation, which is simply a justification for which candidate they consider to be the most suitable for the position.
4. The election committee moderates the elections themselves during the associated section meeting where all candidates are allowed to give speeches and one/several are then elected by the section members who attend. It is also possible to apply for a post on site.

The selection committee attaches great importance to maintaining the integrity of all applicants and to managing the process as impartially and equally for everyone as possible. The selection committee's interviews are for preparing the candidate for SM and are a chance to brainstorm ideas before their speech and ask questions. The selection committee uses the interview as a basis for compiling a foreword for each position - a very difficult task as all applicant section members of the I-Section are usually highly suitable - and it is worth pointing out that it is the section that ultimately chooses the elected representative and the selection committee encourages therefore all candidates to continue their candidacy regardless of who was nominated.
